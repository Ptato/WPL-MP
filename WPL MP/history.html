                                    <p>Silver Valley Institute was established in 2004 under the name Hidden Springs Community School. The mission of the school was to provide students in the Treasure Valley with a quality, independent education that focused on engaging and active learning, a commitment to the environment, and dedication to the school and local communities. Located just north of Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Hidden Springs Community School opened its doors with 57 students enrolled in the primary through eighth grade. Since its opening, the school’s dynamic educational environment has continued to evolve.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Soon after the school began, word started to spread. In just three years, enrollment doubled. In 2007, the school moved from Dry Creek Valley to southeast Panvel and changed its name to Silver Valley Institute. With additional land to grow into, the school was initially housed in an old Forest Service building and three modular buildings.
                                        <br><br>
                                        By 2009, the school was accredited by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and Universities (NASCU). Wanting to develop a global student body, the school’s first international exchange students arrived in 2010. They came from Russia, Thailand, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Chile and Colombia. The following year, enrollment increased again with nineteen international students from countries including Austria, Chile, France, Germany, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Spain, Thailand and Vietnam.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In 2011, the school became an accredited member of the Northwest Association of Independent Schools (NWAIS). We changed our name to Silver Valley Institute in 2007, reflecting our commitment to an international student body and community — as well as a commitment to the International Baccalaureate Programs. We had also grown to offer all grades, from grade 1 to grade 10.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In 2009, Silver Valley Institute was granted authorization to offer the Primary Years Program and Middle Years Program and began offering a dual language — Spanish and English — full day preschool. Athletic programs became formalized. We also defined our Five Pillars, which include academic excellence, community and service, leadership by example, international understanding, and outdoor education. Moving forward, the pillars helped ensure that students at every grade had opportunities to flourish and grow.
                                        <br><br>
                                        We were also the recipient of the Governor’s Brightest Star Award in 2015, in recognition of our service to the community.
                                        In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Silver Valley Institute opened in August of 2020 offering blended learning with on-site and virtual learning options for families.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Throughout our history, the school community has remained committed to creating an environment in which students are known, supported, challenged, and encouraged to grow.
